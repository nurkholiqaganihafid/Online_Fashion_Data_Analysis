# ðŸ“ŒOnline_Fashion_Data_Analysis
- __*Online Fashion Analysis*__ is a data analysis project that uses sales data from a fashion company called Dicoding Collection (DiCo). DiCo is an online company that produces and sells various fashion items. DiCo realizes the importance of data in developing a business, so they store all sales history, product information, and customer data in a database.
- The goal of this project was to evaluate the company's sales performance, understand the most and least sold fashion products, and gain a deeper understanding of customer demographics. By understanding customers better, DiCo can create more efficient campaign strategies.
- This database consists of four tables, including **customers**, **orders**, **products**, and **sales**. [Legend](https://github.com/nurkholiqaganihafid/Online_Fashion_Data_Analysis/blob/main/dataset/Legend.txt)
